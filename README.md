# discord-color-cards
Discord chat game. Who will be the first to run out of cards? Only the player with the correct color, number or symbol may discard a card. You can't lay? Then I guess you'll have to pick up a card! Special cards add to the fun. Let yourself be surprised. - It's simple to understand and easy to set up.
